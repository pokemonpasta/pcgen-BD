If aegyls carry a heavy load or wear heavy armor, their flight speed drops to 30 feet with poor maneuverability (-4 penalty on Fly checks). An aegyl's wing span is typically 12 feet, and cannot fly in an area that does not allow them to fully extend their wings.

While in midair, aegyls can move up to 5 feet in any horizontal direction for every 1 foot they fall, at a speed of 60 feet per round.
