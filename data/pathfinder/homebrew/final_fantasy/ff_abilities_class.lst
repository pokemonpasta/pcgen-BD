Starting at 2nd level, an archer gains one archery talent. He gains an additional archery talent for every 2 levels of archer attained after 2nd level. Unless otherwise stated, an archer cannot select an individual talent more than once. Talents marked with an asterisk(*) cannot be combined with other asterisked talents, and each of these talents can only be used once per round each.

Evasion				KEY:Archer ~ Evasion				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Archer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary			SOURCELINK:https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/core-classes/archer/												DESC:At 3rd level and higher, an archer can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If he makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the archer is wearing light armor. A helpless archer does not gain the benefit of evasion.
#Note: Agile Archer implementation isn't sufficient for weapons that add STR, needs rework
Agile Archer			KEY:Archer ~ Agile Archer			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Archer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary			SOURCELINK:https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/core-classes/archer/												DESC:Starting at 3rd level, when making a ranged attack an archer may add his Dexterity modifier (this bonus is halved if he has a level in another non-prestige class and this is not his favored class) to the damage roll while using a bow or crossbow. If an effect or item would allow an archer to use his Strength for ranged weapon damage rolls, he instead uses Dexterity, but it doesn’t stack. For example, an archer using a composite longbow can decide to use his STR modifier up to the rating of the bow, or use all of his DEX modifier to damage regardless of the composite bow’s rating. &nl; An archer still takes the penalty to damage from having a STR modifier lower than 0 made with non-composite bows, as well as the -2 penalty on attacks rolls and damage penalty when having a STR modifier lower than the composite value of a composite bow.

Improved Archery Style		KEY:Archer ~ Improved Archery Style		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Archer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary			SOURCELINK:https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/core-classes/archer/												DESC:At 5th level, an archer’s aptitude in his archery improves. He gains one of the following feats as a bonus feat or a feat from the previous ability: Crossbow Mastery, Expert Sniper, Improved Precise Shot, Parting Shot, and Manyshot, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat. As before, the benefits of this ability apply only when he wears light or no armor. He loses all benefits of this ability when wearing medium or heavy armor.																																																																																																																		BONUS:ABILITYPOOL|Archery Style Feat|1
Called Shot				KEY:Archer ~ Called Shot			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Archer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary			SOURCELINK:https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/core-classes/archer/												DESC:At 5th level, while using aim at a target, the archer can attempt to strike a specific body part on an aimed target within the first range increment of his bow and crossbow, to cause various effects. The archer must declare his intention to attempt a called shot and designate the specific target and body part before the attack roll is made. The archer then makes ranged attacks as normal (can make multiple called shots as his number of attacks allowed). A successful attack deals weapon damage normally and causes debilitating secondary effects. Conditions and penalties incurred by called shot lasts for 24 hours, or until the creature is successfully treated with a DC 15 Heal check, or until it receives the benefit of a restora spell or equivalent effect. If damage reduction completely negates the damage from a called shot, the called shot has no effect. If hit point damage does get through, the called shot has normal effects. Creatures immune to critical hits are immune to the effects of a called shot. Multiple successful called shots against the same body part or body parts of a single creature are not cumulative.
Fast Movement			KEY:Archer ~ Fast Movement			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Archer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary			SOURCELINK:https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/core-classes/archer/												DESC:At 6th level, when not firing or reloading, archer can quickly change position. When wearing light or no armor and carrying no more than a light load, his base move speed increases by 10 feet. This bonus increases by 10 feet for every three archer levels after 6th level.																																																																																																																																																BONUS:MOVEADD|TYPE.Walk|floor(ArcherLVL/3-1)*10|PREMULT:2,[!PREEQUIP:1,TYPE=Armor.Heavy,TYPE=Armor.Medium],[PREVAREQ:ENCUMBERANCE,0]
Uncanny Dodge			KEY:Archer ~ Uncanny Dodge			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Archer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary			SOURCELINK:https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/core-classes/archer/												DESC:Starting at 7th level, an archer can react to danger before his senses would normally allow him to do so. He cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does he lose his Dexterity bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. He still loses his Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. An archer with this ability can still lose his Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against him. If an archer already has uncanny dodge from a different class, he automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.
Quick Shot				KEY:Archer ~ Quick Shot				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Archer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary			SOURCELINK:https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/core-classes/archer/												DESC:Also at 7th level, whenever an archer makes a full attack with a bow or crossbow, he can make one additional ranged attack. This attack is at the archer’s highest base attack bonus, but each attack in the round (including the extra one) takes a –2 penalty. This ability stacks with Rapid Shot feat.
Heavy Pull				KEY:Archer ~ Heavy Pull				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Archer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary			SOURCELINK:https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/core-classes/archer/												DESC:At 8th level, the archer can pull on a bowstring or taut their crossbow in such a way that they can deal considerably more damage than others who are less talented with ranged weapons. An archer treats any bow or crossbow as 1 size category larger when calculating damage. This does not stack with any similar abilities.																																																																																																																																								BONUS:WEAPONPROF=TYPE.Archery|DAMAGESIZE|2
Safe Shot				KEY:Archer ~ Safe Shot				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Archer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary			SOURCELINK:https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/core-classes/archer/												DESC:Beginning at 9th level, the archer no longer provokes attacks of opportunity when making a ranged attack with his bow or crossbow. When making other ranged attacks, such as throwing a dagger, the archer provokes as normal.
Archery Style Mastery		KEY:Archer ~ Archery Style Mastery		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Archer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary			SOURCELINK:https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/core-classes/archer/												DESC:At 10th level, an archer’s aptitude in his archery improves again. He gains one of the following feats as a bonus feat or a feat from the previous two abilities: Master Sniper, Pinpoint Targeting and Shot on the Run, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat. As before, the benefits of this ability apply only when he wears light or no armor. He loses all benefits of this ability when wearing medium or heavy armor.																																																																																																																				BONUS:ABILITYPOOL|Archery Style Feat|1
Ranged Cleave			KEY:Archer ~ Ranged Cleave			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Archer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary			SOURCELINK:https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/core-classes/archer/												DESC:A bow in the hands of an 11th-level archer becomes a weapon capable of shots with incredible power and precision. Whenever an archer deals enough damage to a creature with a bow or crossbow to drop the creature below 0 hit points, the archer receives a second attack against another creature within half the weapon’s range increment of the first target. If the second target is dropped below 0 hit points by the attack, the archer may take a third attack against another creature within one-quarter of the weapon’s range increment from the second target, and so on – the maximum distance between potential targets halving each time a target is successfully dropped.
Improved Evasion			KEY:Archer ~ Improved Evasion			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Archer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary			SOURCELINK:https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/core-classes/archer/												DESC:At 11th level, the archer’s evasion ability improves. This works like evasion, except that while the archer still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks, he henceforth takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless archer does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.
Take Aim				KEY:Archer ~ Take Aim				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Archer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary			SOURCELINK:https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/core-classes/archer/												DESC:At 13th level, whenever the archer uses the aim ability, he can double the bonuses. He can use this ability %1 times per day.|DEX																																																																																																																																																																								TEMPBONUS:PC|VAR|ArcherAimedTargetBonus|floor(ArcherLVL/5+1)
Evasive Archer			KEY:Archer ~ Evasive Archer			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Archer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary			SOURCELINK:https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/core-classes/archer/												DESC:Also at 13th level, an archer gains a +2 dodge bonus to AC against ranged attacks.

Critical Aim			KEY:Archer ~ Critical Aim			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Archer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary			SOURCELINK:https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/core-classes/archer/												DESC:At 14th level, the archer’s aim becomes a precise deadliness. The critical threat range of all bows and crossbows in the hands of the archer is increased by 1. At 18th level, this increases by 1 again. This increase stacks with Improved Critical or Keen effects but applies after.																																																																																																																																															BONUS:WEAPONPROF=TYPE.Archery|CRITRANGEADD|1	BONUS:WEAPONPROF=TYPE.Archery|CRITRANGEADD|1|PREVARGTEQ:ClassProgression_Archer,18
Racking Critical			KEY:Archer ~ Racking Critical			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Archer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary			SOURCELINK:https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/core-classes/archer/												DESC:At 15th level, when an archer confirms a critical hit with a bow or crossbow, the creature suffers such racking pain that its defenses are lowered temporarily. All cases of DR and hardness on that creature may be ignored by the archer and his allies until the start of the archer’s next turn.
Volley				KEY:Archer ~ Volley				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Archer Class Feature.SpecialAttack.Extraordinary				SOURCELINK:https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/core-classes/archer/												DESC:At 17th level, as a full-round action, an archer can make a single bow or crossbow attack at his highest base attack bonus against any number of creatures in a 30-foot-radius burst, making separate attack and damage rolls for each creature.
Improved Uncanny Dodge		KEY:Archer ~ Improved Uncanny Dodge		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Archer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary			SOURCELINK:https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/core-classes/archer/												DESC:An archer of 17th level or higher can no longer be flanked. This defense denies an enemy the ability to gain a bonus on attack rolls by flanking him, unless the attacker has at least four more character levels than the archer does.
Ranged Defense			KEY:Archer ~ Ranged Defense			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Archer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary			SOURCELINK:https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/core-classes/archer/												DESC:At 19th level, an archer gains DR 5/- against ranged attacks. In addition, as an immediate action, he can catch an arrow or bolt fired at him and shoot it any target he chooses.																																																																																																																																																																ASPECT:CombatBonus|DR 5/- against ranged attacks.
Aim Mastery				KEY:Archer ~ Aim Mastery			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Archer Class Feature.SpecialAttack.Extraordinary				SOURCELINK:https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/core-classes/archer/												DESC:At 19th level, the archer becomes a master at capturing or killing his aimed targets. As a standard action, he can make a single bow or crossbow attack against an aimed target at his full base attack bonus, choosing one of the following effects: kill, knock unconscious for 1d4 hours, or paralyze for 2d6 rounds. If the attack succeeds, the target takes damage normally and must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 10 + half of the archer’s level + his Dexterity modifier) or suffer the additional effect. Whether or not the target succeeds, it cannot be targeted by this ability again (by any archer) for 24 hours.
Master Archer			KEY:Archer ~ Master Archer			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Archer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary			SOURCELINK:https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/classes/core-classes/archer/												DESC:At 20th level, an archer’s skill with archery becomes legendary. Any attacks made with any bow or crossbow that the archer wields automatically confirm all critical threats and have their damage multiplier increased by 1 (×2 becomes ×3, for example). In addition, he cannot be disarmed while wielding any bow or crossbow.

The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a bard’s song is 10 + the song’s level + the bard’s Charisma modifier. In addition, a bard gains additional MP for having a high attribute (Charisma—see Table: Bonus MP per Day (by Spell Level) on the MP System page).
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Bard ~ Songs.MOD																																														DESC:&nl; Songs are functionally categorized into two types: normal songs and maintained songs. Normal songs largely behave the same as spells, whilst maintained songs require the bard to actively maintain them (a free action) every round to keep their effects. Maintained songs effects end immediately if the bard is rendered helpless (ie: knocked unconscious or paralyzed), or otherwise prevented from taking a free action to maintain it each round. A bard may only have one maintained song active at a time, with maintained songs possessing vastly different traits than that of normal songs. They are as follows:
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Bard ~ Songs.MOD																																														DESC:&nl; - The bard may perform normal songs while maintained songs are active. Any normal song that requires concentration to maintain still allows the bard to continue his maintained songs, but does not allow the bard to start a new song until he ends that song.
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Bard ~ Songs.MOD																																														DESC:&nl; - Creatures must be within the song’s range for the bard to maintain its effects. If a creature affected by a song leaves its range, the effect persists until the start of their next turn.
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Bard ~ Songs.MOD																																														DESC:&nl; - If a maintained song only targets a certain number of creatures, the bard may switch the target(s) of his maintained song once at the beginning his turn (provided that they are within the song’s range), immediately ending the song’s effects on the previous target(s).
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Bard ~ Songs.MOD																																														DESC:&nl; - Any song that is maintained in which forces a saving throw on a creature does so every round (while within range) until the creature fails their saving throw that applies that song’s effect; all subsequent rounds then maintain that effect on the creature for the song’s duration or until dismissed.
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Bard ~ Songs.MOD																																														DESC:&nl; - If a creature is targeted by a maintained song and possesses spell resistance, a caster level check is imposed on the bard for every round until the bard passes, at which point all subsequent rounds do not require a caster level check for that song.
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Bard ~ Songs.MOD																																														DESC:&nl; Starting a new song provokes an attack of opportunity and requires concentration checks as if they were spells.

If he does not use an instrument, in the case of Perform (Act), (Comedy), (Dance), (Oratory), (Sing), etc., he does not gain any bonuses on musical power. &nl; Rolling a natural 1 with an instrument causes it to gain the broken condition, receiving a -2 penalty on attack rolls and halving the bard’s skill bonus to Perform checks with that instrument.

Dual Spellcasting			KEY:Red Mage ~ Dual Spellcasting			SORTKEY:Red Mage Class Feature03a				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Red Mage Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.171	DESC:This Limit Break allows the red mage to cast a healing spell and a damage spell in the same round for a duration of 1 round + 1 round per four red mage levels. MP must be paid for both spells. This limit break requires only a swift action.
Flexibility				KEY:Red Mage ~ Flexibility				SORTKEY:Red Mage Class Feature04a				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Red Mage Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.171	DESC:This Limit Break allows the red mage to change his current HP total and current MP total on the fly. As an immediate action for a duration of 1 round + 1 round per four red mage levels, the red mage can swap any number of points from HP to MP or from MP to HP on a 1 for 1 basis. The red mage cannot swap below 1 hit point. This limit break requires only a swift action.
Spells				KEY:Red Mage ~ Spells					SORTKEY:Red Mage Class Feature05a				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Red Mage Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.171	DESC:A red mage casts red magic spells which are drawn from the red mage spell list. A red mage begins play with 2 1st level red mage spells of his choice. At each new red mage level, he gains one new spell of any spell level or levels that he can cast (based on his new red mage level). Like most mages, a red mage can find or purchase scrolls with spells to add to his repertoire. To learn or cast a red mage spell, the red mage must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level (Cha 11 for 1st-level spells, Cha 12 for 2nd-level spells, and so forth). The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a red mage's spell is 10 + the spell level + the red mage's Charisma modifier. In addition, a red mage gains additional MP for having a high attribute (Charisma).

These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume MP and may be used again. Red mages begin with 2 0-level spells and gain an additional 0-level spell every four levels after 1st level.
Ruby Knowledge			KEY:Red Mage ~ Ruby Knowledge				SORTKEY:Red Mage Class Feature09a				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Red Mage Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.172	DESC:A red mage is specialized in dealing and healing damage with his spells. Whenever a red mage casts a spell that deals hit point dice damage, he adds his Intelligence bonus (if any) to the amount of damage dealt. Whenever a red mage casts a spell that heals hit point dice damage, he adds his Wisdom bonus (if any) to the damage healed. A single spell can never gain this extra damage or healing more than once per casting. If a spell deals or heals damage for more than 1 round, it does not gain the benefit of the ruby knowledge ability. The bonus from the this ability applies only to spells that he casts as a red mage, not to those he might have by virtue of levels in another class.
Spell Combat			KEY:Red Mage ~ Spell Combat				SORTKEY:Red Mage Class Feature10a				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Red Mage Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.172	DESC:At 1st level, a red mage learns to cast spells and wield his weapons at the same time. This functions much like two-weapon fighting, but the off-hand weapon is a spell that is being cast. To use this ability, the red mage must have one hand free, while wielding a light or one-handed melee weapon in the other hand. As a full-round action, he can make all of his attacks with his melee weapon at a -4 penalty and can also cast any spell from his red mage spell list with a casting time of 1 standard action (any attack roll made as part of this spell also takes this penalty). If he casts this spell defensively, he can decide to take an additional penalty on his attack rolls, up to his Charisma bonus, and add the same amount as a circumstance bonus on his Concentration check. If the check fails, the spell is wasted, but the attacks still take the penalty. A red mage can choose to cast the spell first or make the weapon attacks first, but if he has more than one attack, he cannot cast the spell between weapon attacks.
Arcane Pool				KEY:Red Mage ~ Arcane Pool				SORTKEY:Red Mage Class Feature11a				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Red Mage Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.172	DESC:At 2nd level, the red mage gains a reservoir of mystical arcane energy that he can draw upon to fuel his powers and enhance his weapon. This arcane pool has a number of points equal to 1/2 his red mage level (minimum 1) + his Charisma modifier. The pool refreshes once per day when the red mage rests for a full 8 hours. At 2nd level, a red mage can expend 1 point from his arcane pool as a swift action to grant any weapon he is holding a +1 enhancement bonus for 1 minute. For every four levels beyond 2nd the weapon gains another +1 enhancement bonus, to a maximum of +5 at 18th level. These bonuses can be added to the weapon, stacking with existing weapon enhancement to a maximum of +5. Multiple uses of this ability do not stack with themselves. At 6th level, these bonuses can be used to add any of the following weapon properties: dancing, flaming, flaming burst, frost, icy burst, keen, shock, shocking burst, speed, or vorpal. Adding these properties consumes an amount of bonus equal to the property's base price modifier. These properties are added to any the weapon already has, but duplicates do not stack. If the weapon is not magical, at least a +1 enhancement bonus must be added before any other properties can be added. These bonuses and properties are decided when the arcane pool point is spent and cannot be changed until the next time the red mage uses this ability. These bonuses do not function if the weapon is wielded by anyone other than the red mage. A red mage can only enhance one weapon in this way at one time. If he uses this ability again, the first use immediately ends.

Spellstrike				KEY:Red Mage ~ Spellstrike				SORTKEY:Red Mage Class Feature13a				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Red Mage Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.173	DESC:At 2nd level, whenever a red mage casts a single-target spell, he can deliver the spell through any weapon he is wielding as part of a melee attack. Instead of the free melee touch attack normally allowed to deliver the spell, a red mage can make one free melee attack with his weapon (at his highest base attack bonus) as part of casting this spell. If successful, this melee attack deals its normal damage as well as the effects of the spell. If the red mage makes this attack in concert with spell combat, this melee attack takes all the penalties accrued by spell combat melee attacks. This attack uses the weapon's critical range (20, 19-20, or 18-20 and modified by the keen weapon property or similar effects), but the spell effect only deals x2 damage on a successful critical hit, while the weapon damage uses its own critical modifier.
Armored Mage			KEY:Red Mage ~ Armored Mage				SORTKEY:Red Mage Class Feature14a				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Red Mage Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.173	DESC:At 3rd level, normally, armor heavier than light armor interferes with a spell-caster's gestures, which can cause spells to fail if those spells have a somatic component. A red mage's limited focus and specialized training, however, allows him to avoid spell failure so long as he sticks to light armor and light shields. This training does not extend to medium armor or to heavy shields. This ability does not apply to spells gained from a different spell-casting class. At 7th level, a red mage learns to use medium armor with no chance of spell failure. At 10th level, a red mage learns to use heavy shields with no chance of spell failure.
Ruby Arcana				KEY:Red Mage ~ Ruby Arcana				SORTKEY:Red Mage Class Feature15a				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Red Mage Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.173	DESC:As he gains levels, a red mage learns arcane secrets tailored to his specific way of blending martial puissance and magical skill. Starting at 3rd level, a red mage gains one ruby arcana. He gains an additional ruby arcana for every three levels of red mage attained after 3rd level. Unless specifically noted in a ruby arcana's description, a red mage cannot select a particular ruby arcana more than once. Ruby arcana that affect spells can only be used to modify spells from the red mage spell list unless otherwise noted.
Quick Cast				KEY:Red Mage ~ Quick Cast				SORTKEY:Red Mage Class Feature16a				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Red Mage Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.177	DESC:Beginning at 4th level, a red mage can cast one spell each day as a swift action, so long as the casting time of the spell is 1 standard action or less. He can use this ability twice per day at 8th level, three times per day at 12th level, and four times per day at 16th level.
Convert				KEY:Red Mage ~ Convert					SORTKEY:Red Mage Class Feature17a				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Red Mage Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.177	DESC:Beginning of 5th level, a red mage can convert hit points into MP as a free action. For every 5 hit points converted, the red mage receives 1 MP. The red mage cannot convert below 1 hit point and can only convert MP equal to his red mage level. The red mage can use this ability a number of times per day equal to his Charisma modifier.
