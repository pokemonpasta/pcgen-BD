SOURCEPAGE:p.166																																																															BENEFIT:Whenever you are adjacent to an ally who also has this feat, you receive a +4 circumstance bonus on attacks of opportunity against creatures that you both threaten.

If a creature fails this second saving throw, it suffers the full effects of the spell, as if it had failed its first saving throw. A persistent spell uses up a spell slot two levels higher than the spell's actual level. Spells that do not require a saving throw to resist or lessen the spell's effect do not benefit from this feat.

SOURCEPAGE:p.169																																																															BENEFIT:Whenever you are wielding a shield and are adjacent to an ally who also has this feat, the AC bonus from your shield increases, depending on the shield wielded by your ally. If your ally is wielding a buckler or a light shield, your shield bonus increases by +1. If your ally is wielding a heavy shield or a tower shield, your shield bonus increases by +2. You keep these bonuses even if your ally loses his shield bonus due to making a shield bash attack. If an adjacent ally with this feat uses a tower shield to grant total cover, you also benefit if an attack targeting you passes through the edge of the shield (see page 153 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).

If the spell effect also causes the creature to become sickened, the duration of this metamagic effect is added on to the duration of the spell. A sickening spell uses up a spell slot two levels higher than the spell's actual level. Spells that do not inflict damage do not benefit from this feat.

Whenever you cast that spell you may apply any one metamagic feat you have to that spell without affecting its level or casting time, as long as the total modified level of the spell does not use a spell slot above 9th level. In addition, if you have other feats which allow you to apply a set numerical bonus to any aspect of this spell (such as Spell Focus, Spell Penetration, Weapon Focus [ray], and so on), double the bonus granted by that feat when applied to this spell.
Spider Step												CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:General																												PRECLASS:1,Monk=6																																																	PRESKILL:2,Acrobatics=6,Climb=6																																																																																DESC:Your physical mastery grants you an impossible stride.

Stabbing Shot											CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat						PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Rapid Shot																																																						PRERACE:1,RACESUBTYPE=Elf																																																																																															DESC:You can clear the way to continue using your bow.																																																																																																																																																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.170																																																															BENEFIT:When adjacent to an opponent and making a full-attack action with a longbow or shortbow (including composite bows), you may choose to make a melee attack against that opponent with a drawn arrow rather than firing it. If the attack hits-whether or not it does damage-your target is pushed back 5 feet away from you. You can then fire arrows from your bow normally, at the original target, or at another target within range. This melee attack replaces the extra attack from Rapid Shot, and all of your attack rolls for the round (the melee attack and the ranged attacks) take a -2 penalty. If your initial attack leaves you with no enemies threatening you, you can make the subsequent ranged attack or attacks without provoking attacks of opportunity.

SOURCEPAGE:p.170																																																															BENEFIT:When using the Step Up or Following Step feats to follow an adjacent foe, you may also make a single melee attack against that foe at your highest base attack bonus. This attack counts as one of your attacks of opportunity for the round. Using this feat does not count toward the number of actions you can usually take each round.

This does not provoke an attack of opportunity.
Swap Places												CATEGORY:FEAT		TYPE:Combat.Teamwork																																																																																																																																																																			DESC:You are skilled at changing places with your ally during a chaotic melee.																																																																																																																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.172																																																															BENEFIT:Whenever you are adjacent to an ally who also has this feat, you can move into your ally's square as part of a normal movement (including a 5-foot step).

Your ally must be the same size as you to utilize this feat. Your ally does not provoke an attack of opportunity from this movement, but you provoke as normal. This movement does not count against your ally's movement on his next turn.

SOURCEPAGE:p.173																																																															BENEFIT:Whenever you score a critical hit with a melee attack, you can trip your opponent, in addition to the normal damage dealt by the attack.

For example, having a crowbar would be DC 12, whereas a flask of acid would be DC 20. The item must be something you can easily carry-if you are on foot and have only a backpack, for example, you could not have a large iron cauldron. You cannot have magical items using this feat, nor can you have specific items, such as the key to a particular door. If you are stripped of your equipment or possessions, you lose the benefits of this feat until you have at least a day to resupply and "acquire" new items. You must pay of these items normally. Special - At the GM's option, a character can substitute the Survival skill for Sleight of Hand with this feat. Such a choice is permanent.

This feat works only with spells whose effects can be negated by a successful Fortitude save. A toxic spell uses up a spell slot 1 level higher than the spell's actual level.

To regain a familiar, you must atone for your deeds with the atonement spell, and pay to have the slain familiar raised from the dead. If your familiar is slain or lost through other means, you can replace it using the normal rules for replacing familiars. Special: This feat can be taken a second time by characters of 7th or higher level if they do not otherwise have access to familiars. Such characters have access to a Calistrian wasp.
